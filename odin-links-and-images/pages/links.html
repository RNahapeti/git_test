    <h1>Links</h1>
    <p>This example is about links and <a href="images.html">images</a>.</p>

    <p>This particular page is about links! There are three kinds of links:</p>

    <ul>
        <!-- this sentance makes no sense, but it was what was provide by "Interneting is Hard" for their Links and Images example -->
        <li>Absolute links, like to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">Mozilla Devloper Network</a>, which is a very good resource for web developers.</li>

        <li>Relative links, like to our <a href="misc/extras.html">extras page</a>.</li>

        <!-- This won't work for our local HTML files -->
        <li>Root-relative links, like to the <a href="/">home page</a> of our website, but those aren't useful to us right now.</li>
    </ul>
