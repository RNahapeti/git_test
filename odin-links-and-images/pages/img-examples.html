    <h1>TOP Image Types Assignment</h1>

    <ul>
        <li><h3>JPEG</h3>
            <img src="../images/mochi.jpg" width="75" alt="mochi smiley face icon in jpeg format - includes non-transparent white background">

            <p>This is an example of a JPEG image (extension .JPG .jpg .jpeg or .JPEG) - JPEGs are designed to show large color pallets in smaller file sizes by intelligently compressing the image. They are good for photos. They don't allow for transparent backgrounds</p>
        </li>

        <li><h3>GIF</h3>
            <img src="../images/mochi.gif" width="75" alt="mochi smiley face icon in GIF format - face is animated with a slight bounce">

            <p>This is an example of a GIF image - the go-to image file for simple animations. They have a limited color pallete and allow for binary (on-off) transparency pixels. Never use this filetype for a photo.</p>
        </li>

        <li><h3>PNG</h3>
            <img src="../images/mochi.png" width="75" alt="mochi smiley face icon in png format - has a transparent background">
 
            <p>This is an example of a PNG image - the go-to image file when transparency is required for the image. Great for anything that is not a photo - also has the added benefit that it isn't compressed the same way jpeg files are. Larger (resolution) files will be much larger in file size, but will be much clearer on a website, especially when it comes to text. Great for good diagrams and icons.</p>
        </li>

        <li><h3>SVG</h3>
            <img src="../images/mochi.svg" width="75" alt="mochi smiley face icon in svg format - this image is generated using math and vectors, not pixels.">

            <p>SVG images are not pixel based, but math based (vectors). You can scale these images to any resolution and they will always appear sharp and in focus (unlike all other image formats). Excelent for logos, icons, graphics ...pretty much anything that PNGs are good for, but even better. Can also be color edited via CSS</p>
